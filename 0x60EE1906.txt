0x07C994D4 = ~z~My dad would say that no politics was politics.

0x0836A9FC = ~z~That old world bullshit, it ain't got no place here.

0x08697B9A = ~z~Okay.

0x08D624A3 = ~z~Yeah.

0x08E18B31 = ~z~You're out throwing lead with Sadie Adler, helping the law chase down criminals...

0x0AEEEDE6 = ~z~So, what were you doing riding around up there anyway?

0x0C97B50E = ~z~Alright...

0x0CE89DBB = ~z~Yeah?

0x0F35B07B = ~z~And you sure don't keep it bottled up inside.

0x2BA1D0B1 = ~z~I don't even know what I'm hearing no more...

0x2CBCF579 = ~z~Told you we'd take 'em no problem, didn't I?

0x2ED54871 = ~z~We'll go up, nice and quiet.~rp~ I'll give it a bit of patter, catch 'em off guard, then we take 'em.

0x5C2C4ED2 = ~z~let's go check it out.

0x5C652E66 = ~z~No, didn't see him. I lost you boys at some point when he was getting out of town.

0x7AF64852 = ~z~Davey... was finished by the time we got up the mountains, Jenny didn't even make it that far.

0x7B82108D = ~z~Because there ain't no judgement here?

0x7FEFF57B = ~z~What about that train job with the oil wagon? Made a good showing there, didn't I?

0x28A9EE82 = ~z~What's that?

0x34A86440 = ~z~You heard him, right? He said the stash was behind a loose board in the bedroom.

0x45B437A1 = ~z~Alright, that'll have to wait. We're nearly there.

0x49EFAFDE = ~z~Alright, alright...

0x60FE5207 = ~z~We split half, other half goes to the gang. Dutch keeps all our savings hidden in a safe spot outside camp.

0x181ECD46 = ~z~Look, there's one of them outside. This is good.

0x195FC2C7 = ~z~I'm sure. Dutch is good at seeing things in people.

0x234BBC30 = ~z~That's what you choose to remember? We got paid, we got out of there.

0x307EFA9C = ~z~You ain't so free of politics.

0x2321A1B3 = ~z~I don't even know what I'm seeing no more. You and Dutch are deputies, you're out throwing lead with Sadie Adler...

0x6677A4FE = ~z~Dutch knows my value to the cause, has from the moment I met him.

0x7825C85A = ~z~You tried to kill him, if I remember the story right.

0x9714A5A5 = ~z~I'm pulling you back on the rails here.

0x9929C385 = ~z~Will you get a move on?

0x7718459E = ~z~Left of the house!

0x56348702 = ~z~Oh, hey Arthur.

0xA33F3C19 = ~z~Got knocked out in Blackwater too, didn't you?
